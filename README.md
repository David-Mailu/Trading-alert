# ðŸ“Š Trading-Alert System

An intelligent server-client alert system for monitoring XAUUSD price movements and providing real-time notifications on volatility and support/resistance (SR) breaks.

Created by [David-Mailu](https://github.com/David-Mailu), this system leverages Pythonâ€™s socket programming to build an efficient local communication framework for traders.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This system is designed to:
- Monitor live XAUUSD prices manually entered by the trader.

- Filter noisy signals using candle similarity and clustering logic.

It consists of:
- `server.py`: Smart logic engine that receives user input and broadcasts actionable alerts.
